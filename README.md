#UI/UX principals

I did not know how to attach the figma to the repo, I tried to export it
but all I got was the a zip folder with 6 images inside. So instead I will
just drop the link below, i took the assignment as me creating a layout
for a bakery company that has an app that acts a social platform and
allow users to register a product with them and sell it to get their 
foot in the door when it comes to the bakery business.
